          It's more than a silly little block game.
          I've been playing Minecraft since July 2010, so I've seen most major updates for game. The game offers "Infinite wonders and endless possibilities" Minecraft isn't actually infinite or endless, but it might as well be due to the large amount of things you can do with the game. My favorite parts of the game are survival and hardcore singleplayer, and survival multiplayer. Minecraft may seem simple at first, but there are a lot of mechanics under the hood and there are ways to manipulate the game in unintended ways. Multiplayer is another big part of Minecraft, where I play on my private servers with friends and family. There are a lot Multiplayer servers, although most are private. My favorite is my private server and 2b2t, the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft is another experience altogether. In summary, Minecraft is a game that is definitely worth a try, and is more than a simple little

          Best game created. No wonder it's so popular.
          Younger kids may not know how to play, as WASD controls might be hard to understand, and they might get scared of mobs and not know how to progress. The combat is good, as mobs only flash red when hurt, and once health is depleted they die. In survival mode, without cheats, you'll die when your health is gone, and you have to keep the hunger bar up, or you'll starve. Hunger bars also heal you. You can respawn when killed. Only in hardcore, you play like survival; gather resources, fight nature to survive, but you can't respawn in hardcore. You can spectate the world or delete it. In creative, no mobs will attack you, and you can fly, and have infinite resources. No food or health is needed.

          People who rate this game 1 star and say it is 'unsafe' are wrong: Minecraft warns you about 3rd party online play - and you can even disable chat, or just play single player. For the 'Monster Problem' this is a FANTASY game. Most fantasy games have death & dying, and if it is too much - enable peaceful mode. The addiction is inevitable, but considering over 200 million individuals bought the game, you can see why. Set a reasonable screen time If you want. Please do your research next time and choose the right review to trust. Peace out!

        God dam this is great
        I Was introduced to Minecraft a month ago and was HEAVILY dissatisfied with the lack of support from other people on this site, if you like games with hardship, fun and good range to do. This is your game. Don’t listen to others they are just angry that they are bad at this game, I saw a post talking about lag and other people on the game not being very nice to others but what did you expect when you decided to play this a server which minecraft dose not own or make, servers are made by players and those players have to look after it if it is a bad server or lagging it’s not minecraft it’s just they players that made it who did not bother to look after there server, thus minecraft is a great game and helps your kids and yourself use imagination to explore and desire your own world!
